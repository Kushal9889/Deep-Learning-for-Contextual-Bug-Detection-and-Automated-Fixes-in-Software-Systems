# Deep-Learning-for-Contextual-Bug-Detection-and-Automated-Fixes-in-Software-Systems

**🔍 Research Focus-**

The study investigates how contextual signals—such as runtime states, user interactions, and system configurations—can be leveraged to:

~Detect latent bugs that evade traditional testing

~Prioritize bug reports based on impact and reproducibility

~Automate the retrieval of relevant patches or code snippets from repositories and forums

**🛠 Technical Contributions-**

I helped design and evaluate a hybrid bug detection pipeline that integrates:

~Contextual trace mining using execution logs, stack traces, and telemetry data

~Semantic code analysis powered by abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and control/data flow graphs

~Natural language processing (NLP) to interpret bug reports and match them with similar issues across platforms (e.g., GitHub, Stack Overflow)

~Vector-based code search using embeddings from models like CodeBERT and GraphCodeB to retrieve semantically similar code fragments

~Automated patch suggestion using reinforcement learning agents trained on historical fix patterns

**🧪 Methodologies and Tools-**

~Built a context-aware bug classifier using supervised learning (Random Forest, XGBoost) trained on labeled datasets of real-world bugs

~Employed static and dynamic instrumentation to capture runtime anomalies and correlate them with code-level triggers

~Designed a search engine prototype that ranks fix candidates using cosine similarity, TF-IDF, and transformer-based embeddings

~Validated system performance using metrics like precision@k, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and bug reproduction fidelity

**🌐 Broader Impact-**

This research contributes to the evolution of self-healing software systems by:

~Reducing developer effort in triaging and resolving bugs

~Enhancing software reliability in mission-critical applications (e.g., healthcare, finance, autonomous systems)

~Promoting cross-platform bug intelligence through federated search and contextual linking

~Enabling continuous integration pipelines to incorporate automated bug detection and fix suggestion modules
